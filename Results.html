<p>show pH (0-3). But basic substances are 
<br>turquoise showing a high pH (9-13). Substances such as soap and alcohol stayed purple, 
<br>meaning they were neutral, or basic,just looking at the color it turns.

<H1>Conclusion</H1>
<p>In this experiment, we clearly saw how red cabbage juice changes color with different 
<br>substances, depending on their pH levels. Very acidic things like lemon juice, orange 
<br>juice and other things that are slighty acid.

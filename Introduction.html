<H1>Introduction</H1>
<font size="6">
<br>This website explains what we did in our chemistry lab with the "PH" experiment. we used red cabbage juice as natural<br> 
  way to test if everyday liquids are acidic, neutral or basic. Red cabbage has a pigment called anyhonacyanin that changes<br>  
  color depending on how it is. The main goal of the experiment was too watch how the colors changed and match them to the Ph<br> 
  level.<br>

<H1>Hypothesis</H1>
Hypothesis We though that adding red cabbage juice to different substances it would make them change into a range of colors,<br> 
  depending on their PH levels. These colors change would help us easily tell if each substance was acidic, basic or neutral and<br>  
  give us a better understanding on how ph works.<br>
